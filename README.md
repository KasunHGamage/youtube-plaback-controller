## Features
- **Increase/Decrease Playback Speed**: Use `Command + Arrow Up` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Arrow Up` (Windows/Linux) to increase the playback speed, and `Command + Arrow Down` or `Ctrl + Arrow Down` to decrease it.
- **Playback Speed Range**: The playback speed can be adjusted from **0.25x** to **4x**.
